# Needleman-Wunsch-Project
Needleman Wunsch Algorithm (Python Implementation)

This program was created for Project #1 of CIIC4025 course at University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus. 

The program consists on the implementation of the Needleman Wunsch algorithm to align biological sequences, hence the file name. For this project we had to make our own implementation of the algorithm with a CSV file as input, passed as an argument through the terminal, and resulting in the creation of a new CSV file named "results.csv".

How does it work? 

Here are some reference videos on how the algorithm is implemented and its fucntionality:
